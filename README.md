 <h1>HEY! I'M DARREN.</h1>
 <p>I AM MOSTLY A FAN OF VIDEO GAMES (MAINLY RPGS OR THINGS LIKE THSC), ALGODOO, ROBLOX GAMES (I MOSTLY LIKE BLOCK TALES, BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS.), AND .. TECHNICALLY OBJECT SHOWS (<strong>I'M ONLY INTO GOEFAV AND AIB</strong>).<br>
 MY FAVOURITES IN THE INTERESTS LISTED ABOVE ARE: <strong>PACKAGE (AIB)</strong>, <strong>D20 (GOEFAV)</strong>, LOTUS FLOWER (GOEFAV), GRIEFER (BLOCK TALES), FREEZER (TDS), DARREN (MURDER DRONES), BRAIDEN (MURDER DRONES).<br>
 NON FANDOM INTERESTS I HAVE ARE GAME CREATION, CHARACTER DESIGN, ART, MUSIC CREATION (I MOST OFTEN USE BEEPBOX), AND STORY WRITING. I LIKE THE IDEA OF CODING, BUT I AM STILL WORKING ON LEARNING IT AND IT FALLS UNDER GAME CREATION SINCE THAT'S WHAT I PLAN TO USE IT FOR<br>

- HEY. I'm DARREN.
- HE/HIM (Fluctuates between HE/HIM and SHE/HER)
- YOU CAN PROBABLY FIND A GOOD AMOUNT OF NEEDED INFO ON MY STRAWPAGE.
- BUT, FOR THE MOST PART, I WILL LIST THINGS HERE!
- I AM MOSTLY A FAN OF VIDEO GAMES (MAINLY RPGS OR THINGS LIKE THSC), ALGODOO, ROBLOX GAMES (I MOSTLY LIKE BLOCK TALES, BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS.), AND .. TECHNICALLY OBJECT SHOWS (I'M ONLY INTO GOEFAV AND AIB). I ALSO LIKE JJBA.
-  ANYTHING NOT MENTIONED HERE THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT IS MOST LIKELY A SIDE INTEREST AND NOT A MAIN ONE.
-  ^^^ EXCEPT MURDER DRONES. I TALK ABOUT IT A LOT BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF CRITICISM AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU DESPISE A LOT OF THE SHOW. THE CHARACTERS ARE FLANDERIZED CARDBOARD CUTOUT TROPES WITH THE ONLY INTERESTING ONES BEING TOSSED TO THE SIDE, AND THE STORY IS MORE FOCUSED ON GIANT ANNOYING LORE MORE THAN IT IS LITTLE DETAILS LIKE HOW WORKER DRONE CIVILIZATION WORKS AND EVERYTHING.
-  I LOVE WORKER DRONES. THEY ARE MY BABYS. I DO NOT OFTEN TALK ABOUT DISASSEMBLY DRONES IF I TALK ABOUT MD. I JUST LIKE THINKING ABOUT WORKER DRONE CIVILIZATION AND BUILDING OFF OF WHAT INFORMATION WE HAVE. I ONLY HAVE 4 DISASSEMBLY DRONE OCS, AND THEY ARE FOR A FRIEND GROUP PROJECT FROM 2 YEARS AGO. I'M STILL PART OF THE FRIEND GROUP, IT'S JUST NOT INTO MURDER DRONES ANYMORE.
- SORRY FOR YAPPING ABOUT THAT.
- MY FAVOURITES IN THE INTERESTS AND SHIT LISTED ABOVE ARE: PACKAGE (AIB), D20 (GOEFAV), LOTUS FLOWER (GOEFAV), GRIEFER (BLOCK TALES), FREEZER (TDS), DARREN (MURDER DRONES), BRAIDEN (MURDER DRONES). I'M PROBABLY FORGETTING SOME CHARACTERS.. SORRY.
- ANYWAYS.
- NON FANDOM INTERESTS I HAVE ARE GAME CREATION, CHARACTER DESIGN, ART, MUSIC CREATION, AND STORY WRITING. I LIKE THE IDEA OF CODING, BUT I AM STILL WORKING ON LEARNING IT AND IT FALLS UNDER GAME CREATION SINCE THAT'S WHAT I PLAN TO USE IT FOR!
- THANKS FOR READING. HAVE A GOOD DAY.
- SORRY IF I SEEM LIKE I'M YELLING I JUST THINK THE PAGE LOOKS COOLER IN CAPS.

Hey! I'm Package.

I'm interested in video games, character design, art, coding, game creation, music creation, and more.
I am currently working on an RPG called KINGS GAMBIT.
I am into Block Tales, AIB (Object Show), GOEFAV (Less so nowadays, but I still like it!), Algicosathlons (I'm most familiar with the greenwhite one), and more!
I don't have much to put here,, sorry.

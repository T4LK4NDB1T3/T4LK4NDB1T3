Hey! I'm Package / Darren.

I'm interested in video games, character design, art, comics, RPG games, music creation, and more.
I am into Block Tales, AIB (Object Show), GOEFAV (Less so nowadays, but I still like it!), Algicosathlons (I'm most familiar with the greenwhite one), and more!
I don't have much to put here,, sorry.

If  you approach me because of a murder drones cos / avatar, please keep in mind I'm uhm.. not enthusiastic about the show. I have a lot of criticism and honestly hatred towards the show, and an obsession with the campers from episode 4. So just,,, yea.

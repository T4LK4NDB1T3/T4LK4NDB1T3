- HEY. I'm DARREN.
- HE/HIM (Fluctuates between HE/HIM and SHE/HER)
- YOU CAN PROBABLY FIND A GOOD AMOUNT OF NEEDED INFO ON MY STRAWPAGE.
- BUT, FOR THE MOST PART, I WILL LIST THINGS HERE!
- I AM MOSTLY A FAN OF VIDEO GAMES (MAINLY RPGS OR THINGS LIKE THSC), ALGODOO, ROBLOX GAMES (I MOSTLY LIKE BLOCK TALES, BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS.), AND .. TECHNICALLY OBJECT SHOWS (I'M ONLY INTO GOEFAV AND AIB). I ALSO LIKE JJBA.
-  ANYTHING NOT MENTIONED HERE THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT IS MOST LIKELY A SIDE INTEREST AND NOT A MAIN ONE.
-  ^^^ EXCEPT MURDER DRONES. I TALK ABOUT IT A LOT BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF CRITICISM AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU DESPISE A LOT OF THE SHOW. I'M NOT GONNA YAP ABOUT MY CRITIQUE, THOUGH.
- MY FAVOURITES IN THE INTERESTS AND SHIT LISTED ABOVE ARE: PACKAGE (AIB), D20 (GOEFAV), LOTUS FLOWER (GOEFAV), GRIEFER (BLOCK TALES), FREEZER (TDS), DARREN (MURDER DRONES), BRAIDEN (MURDER DRONES). I'M PROBABLY FORGETTING SOME CHARACTERS.. SORRY.
- NON FANDOM INTERESTS I HAVE ARE GAME CREATION, CHARACTER DESIGN, ART, MUSIC CREATION (I MOST OFTEN USE BEEPBOX), AND STORY WRITING. I LIKE THE IDEA OF CODING, BUT I AM STILL WORKING ON LEARNING IT AND IT FALLS UNDER GAME CREATION SINCE THAT'S WHAT I PLAN TO USE IT FOR!
- IF YOU FOUND ME OFF PONYTOWN:
FEEL FREE TO INTERACT! I DON'T BITE AS THE NAME SUGGESTS, HEH.
I JUST DON'T LIKE BEING COVERED BY OTHER PEOPLE AND BEING CUDDLED, THOUGH THE CUDDLE ISN'T ALWAYS APPLIED (LIKE, IF I'M TRYING TO CHEER UP SOMEONE WHO IS SAD! OR IF YOU ARE CLOSE ENOUGH.)
I PUT A LOT OF EFFORT AND THOUGHT INTO MY DESIGNS.. I DON'T LIKE TO SEE ANY OF THE INTRICACIES BE COVERED UP BY SOMEONE ELSE.
TOUCH LIKE BOOPS IS ALSO SEMI APPLIED THE SAME WAY AS CUDDLE, BUT I'M MORE FINE WITH THIS.. I JUST DON'T LIKE IT TOO MUCH.
- THANKS FOR READING. HAVE A GOOD DAY.
- SORRY IF I SEEM LIKE I'M YELLING I JUST THINK THE PAGE LOOKS COOLER IN CAPS.
